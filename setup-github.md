# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Steps to push to GitHub:

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `kanjimatch` (or your preferred name)
   - Make it public or private as you prefer
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Add the remote and push:**
   ```bash
   # Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kanjimatch.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Verify your .env file is protected:**
   - Check that your `.env` file is not visible in the GitHub repository
   - The `.gitignore` file should prevent it from being uploaded

## Important Notes:

- Your `.env` file contains sensitive information (Privy App ID) and is now protected by `.gitignore`
- Anyone cloning the repository will need to create their own `.env` file with their Privy App ID
- The README.md file includes setup instructions for new users

## Environment Variables Needed:

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
```
REACT_APP_PRIVY_APP_ID=your_privy_app_id_here
```
